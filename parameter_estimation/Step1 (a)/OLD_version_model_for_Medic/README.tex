This is an older version of the model that was tested before approaching to use the final model for Medic. 

This version does not account for mild cases and recovering cases. 

We also have included the figure predictions_removals_medic_old_version_model.png to illustrate how removals are not well predicted by this model when mild cases 
and recovering cases (infected, but not infectious) are disregarded
